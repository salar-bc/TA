        "Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed. Depending on the Editor you are using, this is either done automatically, or you need to do it manually.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Programming languages generally fall into one of two categories: Compiled or Interpreted. With a compiled language, code you enter is reduced to a set of machine-specific instructions before being saved as an executable file.\n",
        "Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages.\n",
        "\n",
        "With interpreted languages, the code is saved in the same format that you entered. Compiled programs generally run faster than interpreted ones because interpreted programs must be reduced to machine instructions at run-time. It is usually easier to develop applications in an interpreted environment because you don’t have to recompile your application each time you want to test a small section.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compiled languages are all translated by running the source code through a compiler. This results in very efficient code that can be executed any number of times. The overhead for the translation is incurred just once, when the source is compiled; thereafter, it need only be loaded and executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpreted languages, in contrast, must be parsed, interpreted, and executed each time the program is run.\n",
